# Pandas

Sylvain has recommended the tutorial found in [./external/jorisvandenbossche/pandas-tutorial](./external/jorisvandenbossche/pandas-tutorial/README.md) as an excellent resource for learning to use the Pandas data manipulation library. It was written by one of the main maintainers of Pandas.

To get the tutorial, pull in the submodule: `git submodule update --recursive --init`.

This directory contains a Pipfile that you can use to set up a virtual environment with all the right packages via `pipenv install`.
