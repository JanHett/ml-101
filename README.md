# Machine Learning 101 (WIP)

This is a "mini curriculum" designed to allow software engineers not familiar with machine learning to get their hands dirty on machine learning problems.

The material is structured into chapters which you can find in the creatively named `chapters` folder. These are meant to be worked through in order, but feel free to skip any you are already familiar with.

The starting point of any chapter is the file titled `__<SHORT CHAPTER TITLE>__.md`. The chapters also have a directory called `playground` which are a space for you to work on the projects.

## Contributing

Feel free to add chapters or correct mistakes. Just make sure to not commit any solutions or output in Notebooks :-).
