# Machine Learning 101 (WIP)

This is a "mini curriculum" that allows us "regular" Wawzers to get our hands dirty on machine learning problems.

The material is structured into chapters which you can find in the creatively named `chapters` folder. These are meant to be worked through in order, but feel free to skip any you are already familiar with.

The starting point of any chapter is the file titled `__<SHORT CHAPTER TITLE>__.md`. The chapters also have a directory called `playground` which are a space for you to work on the projects.

## Contributing

Feel free to add chapters or correct mistakes. Just make sure to not commit any solutions or output in Notebooks :-).
